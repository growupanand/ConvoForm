description: Clerk Organizations for B2B and multi-tenant apps - org switching,
  roles and permissions, verified domains, and enterprise SSO. Use for team workspaces,
  RBAC, org-scoped routing, member management. Also load this when a project treats
  teams, workspaces, tenants, or companies as its customers - shared accounts, inviting
  teammates, per-seat pricing, per-company data isolation - even when the words
  "organization" or "B2B" are never used.
allowed-tools: WebFetch
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY. Organizations must be enabled in Clerk Dashboard → Organizations. Membership mode (required vs optional) must match the B2B vs B2C + B2B coexistence story of your app.

# Organizations (B2B SaaS)

> **STOP — prerequisite.** Organizations must be enabled before any org-related API, hook, or component works. Two paths: (1) [Dashboard → Organizations settings](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings), or (2) `clerk enable orgs` (see "Agent-first: Programmatic org management" below). Pick the Membership mode deliberately: `Membership required` (default since 2025-08-22) routes signed-in users through the `choose-organization` task and disables personal accounts, while `Membership optional` keeps personal accounts available for B2C + B2B coexistence. Pick `optional` if you need personal subscriptions alongside org subscriptions.

> **Version**: This skill targets current SDKs (`@clerk/nextjs` v7+, `@clerk/react` v6+ — Core 3). Core 2 differences are noted inline with `> **Core 2 ONLY (skip if current SDK):**` callouts — see `clerk` skill for the full version table.

## Should this app use Organizations?

Decide before enabling anything. Read the project, count the signals, then **ask the developer** - do not enable Organizations silently.

**Signals this app is multi-tenant** (recommend Organizations):

- A model that groups users: `Team`, `Workspace`, `Tenant`, `Company`, `Account`
- The same foreign key on most tables: `workspace_id`, `team_id`, `account_id`
- Routes scoped to a tenant: `/[workspace]`, `/[slug]/settings`, `/t/:tenantId`
- "Invite your team", "members", "seats", or "admin" in UI copy or the README
- A `*_members` join table, or hand-rolled `role` / `permission` columns
- Per-seat or per-company pricing

**Weaker signals** - enough to raise the question, not to answer it:

- Sharing or collaboration between individual users: a `Share`, `Collaborator`, or `SharedWith` table keyed on two user IDs
- A `role` or `permission` column with no tenant to scope it to
- "Collaborators", "shared with you", "invite a friend" in copy

**Signals this app is single-user** (do not recommend):

- Every table hangs off `user_id` with no container above it, and nothing is shared
- No invitation, membership, or sharing concept anywhere
- Pricing is per person, or there is none

**How to act:**

| What you found | What to do |
|---|---|
| 2 or more strong signals | Recommend Organizations and name the signals you saw. New app: `clerk init --template b2b-saas`. Existing app: `clerk enable orgs`. |
| 1 strong signal, or any weaker signal | Raise it as an option, state the tradeoff, let the developer choose. Sharing between individual users is not multi-tenancy - a `Share` table pointing at two user IDs has no tenant - but it is often where a product grows one. |
| Nothing above | Don't bring it up. |

**Never enable Organizations without asking.** Enabling it also turns on `Membership required`, which routes every signed-in user through organization selection and disables personal accounts. That is wrong for any app that also serves individuals. If the app needs both, it wants `Membership optional`.

## Quick Start

1. **Enable Organizations** — via [Dashboard → Organizations settings](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings) or `clerk enable orgs` (see Agent-first section). Pick `Membership required` (B2B-only) or `Membership optional` (B2C + B2B).
2. **Create an org** — via `<OrganizationSwitcher />`, `<CreateOrganization />`, or programmatically with `clerkClient().organizations.createOrganization()`.
3. **Protect routes** — read `orgId` / `orgSlug` from `auth()` and gate with `has({ role })` or `has({ permission })`.
4. **Manage members** — send invitations via Backend API or the built-in `<OrganizationProfile />` tab.
5. **Cap membership** — set `maxAllowedMemberships` at org creation or pick a seat-limited Billing Plan (see `clerk-billing` skill).

## Agent-first: Programmatic org management

Org settings (enable toggle, membership cap, admin delete, domains) are patchable via PLAPI Instance Config. Org CRUD + memberships + invitations live in BAPI. Useful for agents seeding orgs, replicating settings across instances, or version-controlling org structure.

Pre-req: a linked project (`clerk auth login` + `clerk link`, see `clerk-cli`) — or an unclaimed app from `clerk init`: `clerk enable orgs` and org CRUD via `clerk api` work with no login at all.

### Enable Organizations + settings via CLI

```bash
clerk enable orgs
```

For additional settings (membership cap, verified domains, admin delete), patch the instance config:

```bash
clerk api --platform PATCH /v1/platform/applications/<app_id>/instances/<ins_id>/config \
  -d '{"organization_settings":{"max_allowed_memberships":50,"domains_enabled":true,"admin_delete_enabled":true}}'
```

### Create / list / delete orgs (BAPI)

```bash
# Create:
clerk api -X POST /v1/organizations \
  -d '{"name":"Acme","slug":"acme","created_by":"user_xxx","max_allowed_memberships":10}'

# List:
clerk api '/v1/organizations?limit=20'

# Get one:
clerk api /v1/organizations/<org_id>

# Update:
clerk api -X PATCH /v1/organizations/<org_id> -d '{"name":"Acme Inc."}'

# Delete:
clerk api -X DELETE /v1/organizations/<org_id>
```

### Memberships

```bash
# Add a user to an org:
clerk api -X POST /v1/organizations/<org_id>/memberships \
  -d '{"user_id":"user_xxx","role":"org:admin"}'

# List members:
clerk api '/v1/organizations/<org_id>/memberships?limit=50'

# Update role:
clerk api -X PATCH /v1/organizations/<org_id>/memberships/<user_id> \
  -d '{"role":"org:member"}'

# Remove:
clerk api -X DELETE /v1/organizations/<org_id>/memberships/<user_id>
```

### Invitations

```bash
# Send:
clerk api -X POST /v1/organizations/<org_id>/invitations \
  -d '{"email_address":"alice@example.com","role":"org:member","redirect_url":"https://app.com/accept"}'

# List pending:
clerk api '/v1/organizations/<org_id>/invitations?status=pending'

# Revoke:
clerk api -X POST /v1/organizations/<org_id>/invitations/<inv_id>/revoke \
  -d '{"requesting_user_id":"user_xxx"}'
```

### Notes

- This handles **org config + CRUD**. Subscription / billing for orgs (org plans, seat-limit pricing) flows through `clerk-billing` skill.
- Roles + permissions catalog is editable in `references/roles-permissions.md`. Custom role creation goes through `clerk config patch` (instance-level role definitions) — see Dashboard's role editor for the UX equivalent.
- For SSO / verified domain provisioning, see `references/enterprise-sso.md`.

## Key Patterns

Examples use `@clerk/nextjs` by default. For other frameworks swap the import to `@clerk/react` (Vite/CRA), `@clerk/astro/components`, `@clerk/vue`, `@clerk/expo`, `@clerk/react-router`, or `@clerk/tanstack-react-start` — the feature-level APIs (`has()`, `orgId`, `<OrganizationSwitcher />`, `<Show>`) are identical across SDKs. Framework-specific patterns (middleware, redirects) live in `references/nextjs-patterns.md`.

### 1. Read Organization from Auth

Server-side access to active organization:

```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const { orgId, orgSlug, orgRole } = await auth()
if (!orgId) {
  // user has no active org — either not in any, or viewing Personal Account
}
```

`auth()` is Next.js-specific. Equivalent server-side accessors per SDK: `auth(event)` (Nuxt via `event.context.auth()`), `context.locals.auth()` (Astro), `getAuth(req)` (Express, after `clerkMiddleware()`). Client-side: `useAuth()` (React-based SDKs) or composables (Vue/Nuxt). All return the same `orgId` / `orgSlug` / `orgRole` shape.

### 2. Dynamic Routes with Org Slug

Route-per-org pattern works in any framework supporting file-based dynamic routes. Next.js example:

```
app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx
app/orgs/[slug]/settings/page.tsx
```

Always verify the URL slug matches the active org slug — otherwise users can hit `/orgs/other-org/...` with a stale `orgSlug` in their session:

```typescript
export default async function OrgPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { orgSlug } = await auth()
  if (orgSlug !== params.slug) {
    redirect('/dashboard')  // or whatever your "no-access" flow is
  }
  return <div>Welcome to {orgSlug}</div>
}
```

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

```typescript
const { has } = await auth()

if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) {
  return <div>Admin access required</div>
}
```

Permission checks use the same `has()` surface:

```typescript
if (!has({ permission: 'org:sys_memberships:manage' })) {
  redirect('/unauthorized')
}
```

**Permission naming convention.** System Permissions prefix with `org:sys_`; custom Permissions use `org:<resource>:<action>`. The full System Permissions catalog lives in `references/roles-permissions.md` — the short list is:

- `org:sys_memberships:{read, manage}`
- `org:sys_profile:{manage, delete}`
- `org:sys_domains:{read, manage}`
- `org:sys_billing:{read, manage}`

Do NOT invent names like `org:create`, `org:manage_members`, `org:update_metadata` — those are not real permission slugs. See `references/roles-permissions.md` for custom roles and the permission table.

### 4. Conditional Rendering with `<Show>`

```tsx
import { Show } from '@clerk/nextjs'

<Show when={{ role: 'org:admin' }}>
  <AdminPanel />
</Show>

<Show when={{ permission: 'org:sys_memberships:manage' }}>
  <MembersTab />
</Show>
```

> **Core 2 ONLY (skip if current SDK):** Use `<Protect role="org:admin">` / `<Protect permission="...">` instead of `<Show>`. `<Show>` replaced both `<Protect>` and `<SignedIn>`/`<SignedOut>` in Core 3.

Astro template syntax for the same component (imported from `@clerk/astro/components`):

```astro
<Show when={{ role: 'org:admin' }}>
  <AdminPanel />
</Show>
```

### 5. OrganizationSwitcher

```tsx
import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

<OrganizationSwitcher
  hidePersonal
  afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug/dashboard"
  afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug/dashboard"
/>
```

Key props:
- `hidePersonal: boolean` — hide the Personal Account option. Defaults to `false`. Pass `true` for B2B-only apps.
- `afterCreateOrganizationUrl`, `afterSelectOrganizationUrl`, `afterLeaveOrganizationUrl`, `afterSelectPersonalUrl` — navigation hooks. `:slug` is substituted at runtime.
- `createOrganizationMode`, `organizationProfileMode` — `'modal' | 'navigation'` (default `'modal'`).

The full prop list lives in the [component reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher).

### 6. Session Task — Choose Organization

When `Membership required` is enabled (the default), users without an org are routed through a `choose-organization` session task after sign-in. Clerk handles this automatically inside `<SignIn />`, but you can host the UI yourself:

```tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

<ClerkProvider taskUrls={{ 'choose-organization': '/session-tasks/choose-organization' }}>
  {children}
</ClerkProvider>
```

```tsx
// app/session-tasks/choose-organization/page.tsx
import { TaskChooseOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return <TaskChooseOrganization redirectUrlComplete="/dashboard" />
}
```

`TaskChooseOrganization` ships as an imported component in the React-based SDKs (`@clerk/nextjs`, `@clerk/react`, `@clerk/react-router`, `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`). For the JS Frontend SDK (`@clerk/clerk-js`) the equivalent is `clerk.mountTaskChooseOrganization(node)` / `clerk.unmountTaskChooseOrganization(node)`.

> **Core 2 ONLY (skip if current SDK):** Session tasks aren't available. Force an org selection at sign-in by redirecting to a page that renders `<OrganizationSwitcher hidePersonal />`.

## Default Roles + System Permissions

| Role | Default meaning |
|------|-------------|
| `org:admin` | Full access — all System Permissions, can manage org + memberships |
| `org:member` | Read members + Read billing Permissions only |

You can create up to 10 custom roles per instance in Dashboard → Organizations → Roles & Permissions. Role-per-org is controlled via **Role Sets** — see `references/roles-permissions.md` for the full model (custom roles, Creator/Default role settings, role sets, and the System Permissions catalog).

## Billing Checks

`has()` also supports plan and feature checks when Clerk Billing is enabled:

```typescript
const { has } = await auth()

has({ plan: 'gold' })        // subscription plan
has({ feature: 'widgets' })  // feature entitlement
```

> **Core 2 ONLY (skip if current SDK):** `has()` only supports `role` and `permission`. Billing checks aren't available.

See `clerk-billing` for the full Billing surface and seat-limit plan model.

## Enterprise SSO

Per-org SAML/OIDC. Configured in Dashboard → Configure → Enterprise Connections (or per-org: Organizations → select org → SSO Connections). The SSO connection owns its domain directly; no separate Verified Domain is required (and the two features are mutually exclusive on the same domain). Auto-join on first SSO sign-in uses JIT Provisioning, not Verified Domains. Key fact: the `provider` field lives on `enterpriseConnection`, not on `enterpriseAccounts[0]` directly. See `references/enterprise-sso.md` for the full flow and correct field access.

```typescript
// Strategy name for Enterprise SSO (Core 3)
strategy: 'enterprise_sso'
```

> **Core 2 ONLY (skip if current SDK):** Uses `strategy: 'saml'` and `user.samlAccounts` instead of `user.enterpriseAccounts`.

## Gotchas

### `maxAllowedMemberships` caps seats

```typescript
const clerk = await clerkClient()
await clerk.organizations.createOrganization({
  name: 'Acme Corp',
  createdBy: userId,
  maxAllowedMemberships: 10,
})

// Update later:
await clerk.organizations.updateOrganization(orgId, {
  maxAllowedMemberships: 25,
})
```

For tier-based seat limits tied to a subscription, use a seat-limited Billing Plan (see `clerk-billing`).

### Billing gates Permissions at the Feature level

When Clerk Billing is enabled, `has({ permission: 'org:posts:edit' })` returns `false` if the Feature associated with that permission is not included in the organization's active Plan — even if the user has the Permission assigned via their role. Ensure the Feature is attached to the active Plan in Dashboard → Billing → Plans → Features.

### Metadata updates REPLACE, not merge

`updateOrganization({ publicMetadata })` overwrites all public metadata. Read first, spread, then write:

```typescript
const org = await clerk.organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })
await clerk.organizations.updateOrganization(orgId, {
  publicMetadata: { ...org.publicMetadata, newField: 'value' },
})
```

Applies identically to `privateMetadata` and to user metadata via `clerkClient.users.updateUser`.

## Error Signatures (diagnose fast)

Most "org-related" failures are configuration, not code. Do not edit components before checking these:

| Error / symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `orgId` / `orgSlug` is `undefined` for a signed-in user | Organizations not enabled for this instance, OR user has no active org (personal account) | Enable in Dashboard → Organizations; check Membership mode; surface `<OrganizationSwitcher />` |
| `has({ permission: 'org:manage_members' })` always `false` | Using an invented permission slug | Use `org:sys_memberships:manage` (see roles-permissions.md catalog) |
| `has({ role })` returns `false` but user looks like an admin | Session token stale after role change | Re-sign-in, or refresh the session: `await clerk.session?.reload()` |
| `has({ permission })` `false` even with the role assigned | Feature not attached to active Plan (Billing gates permissions) | Dashboard → Billing → Plans → attach Feature |
| `<OrganizationSwitcher />` doesn't show "Personal Account" | `Membership required` mode is on (the default since Aug 22, 2025) | Dashboard → Organizations settings → `Membership optional` |
| `TaskChooseOrganization` throws "cannot render when a user doesn't have current session tasks" | Rendered outside a `choose-organization` task context | Wrap in a `choose-organization` session-task route only; don't render unconditionally |
| `enterpriseAccounts[0].provider` is `undefined` | Accessing `provider` at the wrong nesting level | Use `user.enterpriseAccounts[0].enterpriseConnection?.provider` |

## Authorization Pattern (Complete Example)

Server component protecting a slug-scoped admin page:

```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function AdminPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { orgSlug, has } = await auth()

  if (orgSlug !== params.slug) redirect('/dashboard')
  if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) redirect(`/orgs/${orgSlug}`)

  return <div>Admin settings for {orgSlug}</div>
}
```

For middleware-level protection (Next.js) see `references/nextjs-patterns.md`.

## Invitations (short form)

Send from a server action or route handler:

```typescript
import { clerkClient, auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function inviteMember(organizationId: string, emailAddress: string, role: string) {
  const { userId, has } = await auth()

  if (!userId) throw new Error('Not signed in')
  if (!has({ permission: 'org:sys_memberships:manage' })) {
    throw new Error('Not authorized to invite members')
  }

  const clerk = await clerkClient()
  return clerk.organizations.createOrganizationInvitation({
    organizationId,
    inviterUserId: userId,       // required per Backend API
    emailAddress,
    role,                        // e.g. 'org:admin' or 'org:member'
    redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/accept-invite',
  })
}
```

The full lifecycle (list, revoke, bulk create, built-in `<OrganizationProfile />` UI) lives in `references/invitations.md`.

## Workflow

1. **Enable** — Organizations + Membership mode in Dashboard
2. **Create org** — via UI component or Backend API
3. **Invite members** — Backend API or built-in UI, with `inviterUserId`
4. **Gate access** — `has({ role })` / `has({ permission })` with canonical `org:sys_*` names
5. **Scope routes** — `orgSlug === params.slug` on every protected page
6. **Switch orgs** — `<OrganizationSwitcher />` handles the whole flow
