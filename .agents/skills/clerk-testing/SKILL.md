# Testing

## Decision Tree

| Framework | Documentation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Overview | https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/testing/overview |
| Playwright | https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/testing/playwright/overview |
| Cypress | https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/testing/cypress/overview |

## Mental Model

Test auth = isolated session state. Each test needs fresh auth context.
- `clerkSetup()` initializes test environment
- `setupClerkTestingToken()` bypasses bot detection
- `storageState` persists auth between tests for speed

## Workflow

1. Identify test framework (Playwright or Cypress)
2. WebFetch the appropriate URL from decision tree above
3. Follow official setup instructions
4. Use `pk_test_*` and `sk_test_*` keys only

## Best Practices

- Use `setupClerkTestingToken()` before navigating to auth pages
- Use test API keys: `pk_test_xxx`, `sk_test_xxx`
- Save auth state with `storageState` for faster tests
- Use `page.waitForSelector('[data-clerk-component]')` for Clerk UI

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Production keys in tests | Security risk | Use `pk_test_*` keys |
| No `setupClerkTestingToken()` | Auth fails | Call before navigation |
| UI-based sign-in every test | Slow tests | Use `storageState` |

## Framework-Specific

**Playwright**: Use `globalSetup` for auth state
**Cypress**: Add `addClerkCommands({ Cypress, cy })` to support file
