# Clerk Skills Router

## Version Detection

Check `package.json` to determine the Clerk SDK version. This determines which patterns to use:

| Package | Core 2 (LTS until Jan 2027) | Current |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| `@clerk/nextjs` | v5–v6 | v7+ |
| `@clerk/react` or `@clerk/clerk-react` | v5–v6 | v7+ |
| `@clerk/expo` or `@clerk/clerk-expo` | v1–v2 | v3+ |
| `@clerk/react-router` | v1–v2 | v3+ |
| `@clerk/tanstack-react-start` | < v0.26.0 | v0.26.0+ |

**Default to current** if the version is unclear or the project is new. Core 2 packages use `@clerk/clerk-react` and `@clerk/clerk-expo` (with `clerk-` prefix); current packages use `@clerk/react` and `@clerk/expo`.

All skills are written for the current SDK. When something differs in Core 2, it's noted inline with `> **Core 2 ONLY (skip if current SDK):**` callouts. The exception is `clerk-custom-ui`, which has separate `core-2/` and `core-3/` directories for custom flow hooks since those APIs are entirely different between versions.
