# Marketing Email Best Practices

Promotional emails that require explicit consent and provide value to recipients.

## Core Principles

1. **Consent first** - Explicit opt-in required (especially GDPR/CASL)
2. **Value-driven** - Provide useful content, not just promotions
3. **Respect preferences** - Let users control frequency and content types

## Opt-In Requirements

### Explicit Opt-In

**What counts:**
- User checks unchecked box
- User clicks "Subscribe" button
- User completes form with clear subscription intent

**What doesn't count:**
- Pre-checked boxes
- Opt-out model
- Assumed consent from purchase
- Purchased/rented lists

### Informed Consent

Disclose: email types, frequency, sender identity, how to unsubscribe.

✅ "Subscribe to our weekly newsletter with product updates and tips"
❌ "Sign up for emails"

### Double Opt-In (Recommended)

1. User submits email
2. Send confirmation email with verification link
3. User clicks to confirm
4. Add to list only after confirmation

Benefits: Verifies deliverability, confirms intent, reduces complaints, required in some regions (Germany).

## Unsubscribe Requirements

**Must be:**
- Prominent in every email
- One-click (preferred)
- Immediate (GDPR) or within 10 days (CAN-SPAM) (immediate preferred)
- Free, no login required

**Preference center options:** Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly), content types, complete unsubscribe.

## Content and Design

### Subject Lines

- Clear and specific (50 chars or less for mobile)
- Create curiosity without misleading
- A/B test regularly

✅ "Your weekly digest: 5 productivity tips"
❌ "You won't believe what happened!"

### Structure

**Above fold:** Value proposition, primary CTA, engaging visual

**Body:** Scannable (short paragraphs, bullets), clear hierarchy, multiple CTAs

**Footer:** Unsubscribe link, company info, physical address (CAN-SPAM), social links

### Mobile-First

- Single column layout
- 44x44px minimum buttons
- 16px minimum text
- Test on iOS, Android, dark mode

## Segmentation

**Segment by:** Behavior (purchases, activity), demographics, preferences, engagement level, signup source.

Benefits: Higher open/click rates, lower unsubscribes, better experience.

## Personalization

**Options:** Name in subject/greeting, location-specific content, behavior-based recommendations, purchase history.

**Don't over-personalize** - can feel intrusive. Use data you have permission to use.

## Frequency and Timing

**Frequency:** Start conservative, increase based on engagement, let users set preferences, monitor unsubscribe rates.

**Timing:** Weekday mornings (9-11 AM local), Tuesday-Thursday often best. Test your specific audience.

## List Hygiene

**Remove immediately:** Hard bounces, unsubscribes, complaints

**Remove after inactivity:** Send re-engagement campaign first, then remove non-responders

**Monitor:** Bounce rate <2%, complaint rate <0.05%
