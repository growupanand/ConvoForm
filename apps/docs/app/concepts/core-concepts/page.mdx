# Core Concepts

Understanding the terminology used in ConvoForm.

## Form

A **Form** is the blueprint. It defines:
- **Overview**: A high-level description of what the form is for (e.g., "Job Application").
- **Fields**: The specific data points to collect (e.g., "Name", "Years of Experience").

## Conversation

A **Conversation** is a single instance of a user filling out a Form. It is "stateful" and tracks:
- **Transcript**: The history of messages between User and AI.
- **Responses**: The structured data extracted so far.
- **Status**: Whether it is distinct, in-progress, or completed.

## Submission

A **Submission** is the final, read-only record of a completed Conversation. It contains the structured answers extracted by the AI.

## Workflow

1. Admin creates a **Form**.
2. User starts a **Conversation**.
3. AI conducts the interview.
4. User completes the interview -> **Submission** is created.
