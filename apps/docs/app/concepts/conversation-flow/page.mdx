# ConvoForm Conversation Flow

This page explains how ConvoForm orchestrates the conversation between the user and the AI.

    A[User Submits Answer] --> B{Is Answer Valid?};
    B -- No --> C[Generate Follow-up Question];
    C --> D[Stream Question to User];
    B -- Yes --> E[Save Answer];
    E --> F{Next Field Exists?};
    F -- Yes --> G[Generate Question for Next Field];
    G --> D;
    F -- No --> H[Mark Conversation Complete];
    H --> I[Stream End Message];
```

## Explanation

1. **User Answer**: The user inputs text in response to a question.
2. **Validation**: The AI evaluates if the answer satisfies the current field requirements within the context of the conversation.
3. **Branching**:
    - **Invalid**: The AI generates a polite follow-up question to nudge the user towards a valid answer.
    - **Valid**: The answer is stored, and the system moves to the *Next Field*.
4. **Completion**: When all fields are collected, the conversation is marked as complete and a success message is shown.
