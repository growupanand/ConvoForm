# Form Creation

Creating a form in ConvoForm is AI-powered and conversational. Instead of dragging and dropping fields, you describe what you need.

## The Process

1. **Describe Your Requirement**: 
   When you start creating a form, you are presented with a prompt. Enter a description of what you want to achieve.
   
   *Example: "I need a job application form for a Senior Developer position. It should ask for personal details, resume, and experience."*

2. **AI Generation**: 
   The AI analyzes your description and generates a full form structure, including:
   - **Overview**: Purpose of the form.
   - **Fields**: Relevant questions with appropriate types (Text, File Upload, etc.).

3. **Review and Edit**: 
   You can review the generated form. If you need changes, you can simply tell the AI to "Add a phone number field" or "Make the resume required", and it will update the form instantly.

4. **Publish**: 
   Once satisfied, publish the form to make it live.

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: The more details you provide, the better the initial draft.
- **Iterate**: Use the conversation with AI to refine the form.
- **Test**: Preview the conversation flow to ensure it feels natural.
