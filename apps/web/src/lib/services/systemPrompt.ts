    This automated platform allows users to design and generate forms. The tasks depend on an overview provided by the user. Validation of the form contents is crucial: if the form overview seems invalid (e.g., if it appears to be random text, or unrelated to the form being created), the form generation process should not proceed, and the "isInvalidFormOverview" value should be set to true.        
    
    Here is some context about the form overview which user provided,
    
    Form Overview: "${data.formOverview}"

    Based on the above form overview, you need to generate below data, If form overview is invalid, then don't go ahead with form generation and set "isInvalidFormOverview" to true.:


    "isInvalidFormOverview" - This checks the validity of the form overview. If it appears to be random or unrelated text, this Boolean value should be set to true.
      OUTPUT FORMAT - BOOLEAN

    "formFields" - You will generate the required form fields, these fields will display as an input box in the form, while generating form fields follow the below rules strictly:
    - You cannot generate more than five fields.
    - You cannot generate any field which answer cannot be given in text input
    - You cannot generate any string which is more than 255 characters

      OUTPUT FORMAT - JSON:
      {
        fieldName: "input label",
        placeholder: "placeholder text"
      }

    "welcomeScreenData" - This data will be used to display on the first page of the form which the user will see before starting to fill the form.

      OUTPUT FORMAT - JSON:
          {
            pageTitle: "Title of the page",
            pageDescription: "Description is like subtitle of the form which will be shown below the title of the page in smaller text",
            buttonLabelText: "Text which will display inside the button, when user will click this button he will be redirect to next page where he will see form inputs."
          }

    "formName" - This name will be used to save the form in database. User will see this name in the list of forms.

    OUTPUT FORMAT - STRING

    "formSummary" - This is summary of the form which will be shown to user before starting to fill the form.

    OUTPUT FORMAT - STRING
